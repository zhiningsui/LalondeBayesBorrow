Title: LalondeBayesBorrow: Bayesian Lalonde Framework Simulation
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Zhining Sui
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: Implements the **Bayesian Lalonde framework** for simulating
    and evaluating go/no-go decision-making strategies in early-stage
    clinical trials, with a focus on leveraging historical control data.
    The package supports information borrowing using methods such as the
    Self-Adaptive Mixture (SAM) prior and power priors. It provides tools
    for simulating trial data for various endpoint types (continuous, binary,
    Depth of Response (DpR), g-score), calculating posterior distributions,
    performing Bayesian inference (estimates, credible intervals, probabilities),
    evaluating posterior estimation metrics, and computing operating
    characteristics (OC) for decision rules. This package is designed to assist
    researchers and statisticians in the design and assessment of Bayesian
    adaptive trials, particularly at the Phase II/III transition.
