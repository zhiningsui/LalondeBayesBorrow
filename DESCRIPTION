Title: LalondeBayesBorrow: Bayesian Lalonde Framework Simulation
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Zhining Sui
Maintainer: Zhining Sui <zsui.academics@gmail.com>
Description: Implements the Bayesian Lalonde framework for simulating
    and evaluating go/no-go decision-making strategies in early-stage
    clinical trials, with a focus on leveraging historical control data.
    The package supports information borrowing using methods such as the
    Self-Adaptive Mixture (SAM) prior and power priors. It provides tools
    for simulating trial data for various endpoint types (continuous, binary), 
    calculating posterior distributions, performing Bayesian inference 
    (estimates, credible intervals, probabilities), evaluating posterior 
    estimation metrics, and computing operating characteristics (OC) for 
    decision rules. This package is designed to assist researchers and 
    statisticians in the design and assessment of Bayesian adaptive trials, 
    particularly at the Phase II/III transition.
