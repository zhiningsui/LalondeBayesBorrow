# LalondeBayesBorrow: Bayesian Go/No-Go Decision Making for Clinical Trials
`LalondeBayesBorrow` is an R package that provides a comprehensive framework for designing and analyzing clinical trials using the Bayesian Lalonde decision-making framework. It is particularly well-suited for early-stage trials where leveraging historical control data can improve efficiency and decision-making. The package supports both binary and continuous endpoint types.

`LalondeBayesBorrow` can be used for both simulation-based trial design and for the analysis of real-world clinical trial data.
