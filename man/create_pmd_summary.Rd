\title{Create a Data Frame of Posterior Mean Differences (PMD)}
\usage{
create_pmd_summary(
  post_inference_all,
  borrow_to_compare = c("Yes", "No"),
  pmd_var = "est2_lalonde",
  group_vars = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{post_inference_all}{A data frame containing the posterior inference results
from a simulation run, typically from \code{process_sim_results()}.}

\item{borrow_to_compare}{A character vector of length two specifying the two borrowing
conditions from the 'borrow' column to compare (e.g., c("Yes", "No")). The
difference will be calculated as \code{borrow_to_compare[1] - borrow_to_compare[2]}.}

\item{pmd_var}{The name of the single posterior estimate variable to use for
calculating the PMD. Defaults to \code{"est2_lalonde"}.}

\item{group_vars}{A character vector of variable names to group by. If \code{NULL},
the function will automatically use all setting columns.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the mean and standard deviation of the PMD for
each relevant combination of settings.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Posterior Mean Difference (PMD) by comparing any
two specified borrowing scenarios from a simulation run. It correctly handles
both one-to-one comparisons (e.g., 'SAM Prior' vs. 'Fixed Weight') and
one-to-many comparisons against a common baseline (e.g., comparing multiple
borrowing scenarios to a single 'No Borrowing' run).
