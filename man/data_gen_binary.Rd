\usage{
data_gen_binary(
  n_arms = 2,
  nsim = 10,
  n_list = NULL,
  prob_list = NULL,
  arm_names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_arms}{Number of arms (optional, inferred from arm_names if not provided).}

\item{nsim}{A scalar. The number of repetitions of the simulation to be performed.}

\item{n_list}{A named list. Each element represents the number of patients in
the corresponding arm (names must match arm_names). Must contain positive integers.}

\item{prob_list}{A named list. Each element represents the probability of response (binary outcome = 1)
for the corresponding arm (names must match arm_names). Must contain numeric values between 0 and 1.}

\item{arm_names}{A character vector of arm names.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: A data.table with columns \code{nsim}, \code{id}, \code{arm}, \code{resp}, containing
all simulated binary outcomes (0/1) for all arms and all repetitions.
\item \code{true_value}: A data frame of true response rates for each arm,
along with the difference in response rates between the treatment and control
arms (if both are present).
\item \code{summary}: A data.table of response frequencies per arm per simulation, # Corrected from 'freq' to 'summary' based on code
with columns for \code{nsim}, \code{arm}, \code{count} (number of responses), and \code{n} (total patients).
}
}
\description{
This function simulates binary endpoint data (0/1) for multiple study arms
across several simulation repetitions. Each arm's data is generated based on
the specified probabilities of response using a binomial distribution. The
function returns individual-level data, true response rates, and response
frequencies per arm per simulation.
